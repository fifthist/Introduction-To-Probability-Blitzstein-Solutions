There are \({1000\choose 2}\) pairs of sampled individuals - each pair has a \(\frac{1}{10^{6}}\) chance of being the same person. Therefore, we can estimate the "rate of occurrence" of a pair being the same person as \({1000\choose 2}*\frac{1}{10^{6}} = \frac{1000*999}{2*10^{6}} \approx \frac{10^{6}}{2*10^{6}} = 1/2\). Therefore, the number of pairs in the sample that are the same person can be approximated by Pois(1/2).\\

Then the probability that there is at least one pair in the sample that are the same person is \(1-e^{-0.5} = 0.393\). This can be verified as a close approximation in R - the probability that every individual in the sample is unique is the last value resulting from the command cumprod(1-(0:999)/1000000), which is .6067. 1 minus this value gives .3933, the actual probability some two sampled individuals are the same person, which is very close to our Poisson approximation.
