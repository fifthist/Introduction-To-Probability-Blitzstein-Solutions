\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $N_{C}$, the number of Cs, is distributed as $Bin(115,p_{c})$. Using what we know about binomial variance (which can be re-calculated by finding the variance of the indicator r.v.s for a specific letter being C), we have $Var(N_{C}) = 115(p_{c}-p_{c}^{2})$. 

\item Let $I_{j}$ be the indicator random variable that CATCAT starts at
position $j$. Then, the expected number of CATCAT is $\text{E}(X) = 110(p_{C}p_
{A}p_{T})^{2}$.

\item In a sequence of length $6$, the desired options are CATxxx, xCATxx, xxCATx, and xxxCAT. This at first appears to equal $4*(p_{c}p_{a}p_{t})$. However, the CATxxx and xxxCAT cases both count CATCAT, which we have overcounted by 1. None of the other cases can possibly overlap. Therefore, we obtain $$4*(p_{c}p_{a}p_{t})-(p_{c}p_{a}p_{t})^2$

\end{enumerate}
