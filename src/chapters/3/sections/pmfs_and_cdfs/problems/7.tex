To find the probability mass function (PMF) of $X$, we need to determine the probabilities of Bob reaching each level from 1 to 7.

$P(X = 1)$ is simply the probability of Bob reaching level 1, which is 1 since he starts at level 1.

For $2 \leq j \leq 6$, $P(X = j)$ is the probability of reaching level $j$ but not reaching level $j+1$. 
This can be calculated as 

$P(X = j) = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_{j-1}  (1 - p_j)$.

Since the game has only $7$ levels,

$P(X = 7) = p_1  p_2 p_3  p_4  p_5  p_6$.
