\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Each of the $n$ inputs has $m$ choices for an output, resulting in 
$$m^{n}$$ possible functions.

\item If $n \geq m$, at least two inputs will be mapped to the same output, 
so no one-to-one function is possible. 
  
  If $n < m$, the first input has $m$ choices, the second input has $m - 1$ 
  choices, and so on. The total number of one-to-one functions then is 
  $$m(m-1)(m-2)\dots(m-n+1) = \frac{m!}{(m-n)!} $$
\end{enumerate}
