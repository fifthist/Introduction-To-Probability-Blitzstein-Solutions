Let k be the median, and F be the CDF of X, such that
\[F(k) = 1/2\]
since X is continuous from 1 onwards, and 0 otherwise,
\begin{align*}
F(k) &= \int_{-\infty}^{k}{\frac{a}{x^{a+1}}} \\
&= \int_{1}^{k}{\frac{a}{x^{a+1}}} \\
&= 1 - k^{-a}
\end{align*}
It follows that
\begin{align*}
1-k^{-a} &= \frac{1}{2} \\
k &= \sqrt[a]{2}
\end{align*}
The median is therefore \(\sqrt[a]{2}\). \\ 

Let $f$ be the PDF of X, then,
\[f'(x) = -a(a+1)x^{-a-2}\]
since $f'(x) \le 0$ for all $x \in [1,\infty)$, $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing between 1 and \(\infty\) and 0 otherwise, $f(x)$ has maximum at 1, so 1 is the mode.
