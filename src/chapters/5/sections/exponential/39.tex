Let \(O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}\) be the offers received, all distributed as \(Expo(1/12000)\). We want to find \(E(max(O_{1},O_{2},O_{3}))\). Imagine ordering the offers as lowest, middle, and highest price. Let \(D_{1}\) be the lowest price, let \(D_{2}\) be how much more the middle price is than the lowest price, and \(D_{3}\) be how much more the highest price is than the middle price. Then \(D_{1}\) is the minimum of 3 \(Expo(1/12000)\) variables (since it is just the minimum of the 3 offers), \(D_{2}\) is the minimum of 2 \(Expo(1/12000)\) variables (by the memoryless property, given that all other offers are at least the lowest offer, the likelihood that any offer is at least \(k\) more than the lowest is just the probability the offer was at least \(k\) in the first place), and similarly, \(D_{3}\) is the minimum of 1 \(Expo(1/12000)\) variable. In addition, we realize that \(D_{1}+D_{2}+D_{3}\) must equal the highest offer.\\

Then \(E(D_{1}+D_{2}+D_{3}) = \frac{1}{3\lambda} + \frac{1}{2\lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} = 4000+6000+12000 = 22000 \).
