Let $M$ be a random measurement of the distance between the two points.

From the problem statement, $M = 10 + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.04)$.

By the location-scale transformation, $Z = \epsilon/0.2$ is a standard Normal r.v.
Replacing that into the relation of $M$

$$
M = 10 + 0.2 Z
$$

$$
Z = \frac{M-10}{0.2}
$$

\noindent which is the location-scale transformation of $M$. Thus, $M \sim \mathcal{N}(10, 0.04)$.

The exact answer for the requested probability is given by

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
P( |M-10| < 0.4 )
&= P(-0.4 < M-10 < 0.4) \\
&= P(-0.4 < 0.2Z < 0.4) \\
&= P(-2 < Z < 2) = P(|Z| < 2) \\
&= \Phi(2) - \Phi(-2)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
where in the second equality we used the location-scale transformation of $M$, and the $\Phi$ in the last equality is the CDF of the standard Normal distribution.

By the 68-95-99.7\% rule, the probability for a normal r.v. to be within 2 standard deviations from the mean is approximately 95\%. Using this result, the approximate answer is

$$
P( |M-10| < 0.4 ) \approx 0.95
$$
