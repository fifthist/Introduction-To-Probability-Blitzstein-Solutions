Let $F$ be the CDF of $X$.
It is given by $F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}$, for $x>0$.

As per the Universality of the Uniform (UoU), $X$ can be generated from $U$ using $X$'s quantile function:

$$
X = F^{-1}(U)
$$

The quantile function is calculated as

$$
F^{-1}(x) = -\frac{1}{\lambda} \log(1-x)
$$

Plugging the quantile function into the UoU formula

$$
X = -\frac{1}{\lambda} \log(1 - U)
$$
