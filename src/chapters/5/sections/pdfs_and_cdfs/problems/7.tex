a.  F(x) is continuous at its given endpoints: \(F(1) = \frac{2}{\pi}arcsin(1) = \frac{2}{\pi}\frac{\pi}{2} = 1\) and \(F(0) = 0\), and F(x) is differentiable between 0 and 1:\\

b. \(F'(x) = f(x) = \frac{2}{\pi}\frac{d}{dx}(arcsin(\sqrt{x})) = \frac{2}{\pi}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x}})(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}})\)\\

This is a valid PDF despite the discontinuities at 0 and 1 as the integral of \(f(x)\) from 0 to 1 converges, and \(f(x)\) is always positive - the same reason why \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\) has a discontinuity at \(x=0\) but can be integrated from 0 to any positive real number.
