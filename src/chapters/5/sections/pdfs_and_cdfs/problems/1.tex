The PDF is \[f(x) = x e^{-x^2 / 2}\]
\begin{flalign}
    P(X \leq a) & = \int_{0}^a f(x) dx \nonumber\\
    & = \int_{0}^a x e^{-x^2 / 2} dx \nonumber\\
    & = 1 - e^{-a^2 / 2} \nonumber
\end{flalign}

The quantile function $Q$, equal to the inverse of the CDF, is given by

\[Q(a) = \sqrt{-2 \log(1-a)}\]

(a) 
\begin{flalign}
    P(1 < X < 3) & = P(X \le 3) - P(X \le 1) \nonumber\\
    & = e^{-1/2} - e^{-9/2} \nonumber
\end{flalign}

(b)
The general formula for calculating the quartiles is as follows

\[P(X \le q_j) = \frac{j}{4}\]
\[q_j = Q\left( \frac{j}{4} \right) = \sqrt{ -2 \log \left( \frac{3 j}{4} \right) } \text{ , for } j=1,2,3\]

First quartile $q_1$

\[q_1 = 0.759\]

Second quartile $q_2$, also known as median

\[q_2 = 1.18\]

Third quartile $q_3$

\[q_3 = 1.67\]
